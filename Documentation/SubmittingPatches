Commits
-------

- make commits of logical units
- check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" before committing
- do not check in commented out code or unneeded files
- the first line of the commit message should be a short description (50
  characters is the soft limit, see DISCUSSION in git-commit(1)), and should
  skip the full stop
- the body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:
  - uses the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed" or "changes".
  - includes motivation for the change, and contrasts its implementation with
    previous behaviour
- add a "Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>" line to the commit message
  (or just use the option "-s" when committing) to confirm that you agree to the
  Developer's Certificate of Origin (see full text below)

Patch
-----

- use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch
- do not PGP sign your patch
- do not attach your patch, but read in the mail body, unless you cannot teach
  your mailer to leave the formatting of the patch alone.
- be careful doing cut & paste into your mailer, not to corrupt whitespaces.
- provide additional information (which is unsuitable for the commit message)
  between the "---" and the diffstat
- if you change, add, or remove a command line option or make some other user
  interface change, the associated documentation should be updated as well.
- if your name is not writable in ASCII, make sure that you send off a message
  in the correct encoding.
- send the patch to the maintainer (misfire@debugon.org) if (and only if) the
  patch is ready for inclusion. If you use git-send-email(1), please test it
  first by sending email to yourself.
