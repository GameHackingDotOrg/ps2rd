To build the PS2 part of PS2rd, you need a working PS2DEV toolchain with an
up-to-date version of the PS2SDK.

The easiest way to get both is:

 $ git clone git://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain.git
 $ cd ps2toolchain/
 $ sudo ./toolchain-sudo.sh

When everything is set up, go to PS2rd's root directory and run these commands
in your shell:

 $ make clean
 $ make all

(By the way, you can speed up the build process with "make -j jobs".)

This will create the executable ee/loader/ps2rd.elf.

It is recommended to run the ELF with ps2link (you need the high-loading
version!) and ps2client:

 $ make run

If you want to boot it from mass, memory card, etc., make sure that ps2rd.conf
is placed in the same folder as the ELF.
