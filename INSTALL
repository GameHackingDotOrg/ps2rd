To build the PS2 part of ps2rd, you need a working PS2DEV toolchain with an
up-to-date version of the PS2SDK.

Go to the project's root directory to build the ps2rd executable:

$ make rebuild

This will create ee/loader/ps2rd.elf.

Currently, it is recommended to run the ELF with ps2link (you need the high-
loading version!) and ps2client:

$ make run

If you want to boot it from mass, memory card, etc., make sure that ps2rd.conf
is placed in the same folder as the ELF.
