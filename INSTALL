To build the PS2 part of PS2rd, you need a working PS2DEV toolchain with an
up-to-date version of the PS2SDK.

In your shell, go to the project's root directory and run these commands:

$ make clean
$ make all

(By the way, you can speed up the build process with "make -j jobs".)

This will create the executable ee/loader/ps2rd.elf.

Currently, it is recommended to run the ELF with ps2link (you need the high-
loading version!) and ps2client:

$ make run

If you want to boot it from mass, memory card, etc., make sure that ps2rd.conf
is placed in the same folder as the ELF.
