   ps2rd - PS2 remote debugger
---===========================---

ps2rd is a collection of open source tools to debug commercial PS2 games
remotely over Ethernet.

The debugging capabilities will include:
- dump contents of PS2 memory
- write data to PS2 memory
- set breakpoints/watchpoints

Read doc/debugging.txt to find out more about debugging with ps2rd.

ps2rd also includes a powerful cheat system.

The current version allows you to load cheat codes from a text file and to
automatically activate them for the inserted game.

Read doc/cheating.txt for more information.

The directory doc/ is generally the first place to look for any documentation.
