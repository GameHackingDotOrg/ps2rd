---=======---

Artemis is a collection of tools to debug commercial PS2 games remotely over
Ethernet.

The debugging capabilities will include:
- dump contents of PS2 memory
- write data to PS2 memory
- set breakpoints/watchpoints

Read doc/debugging.txt to find out more about debugging with Artemis.

Artemis also includes a powerful cheat system.

The current version allows you to load cheat codes from a text file and to
automatically activate them for the inserted game.

Read doc/cheating.txt for more information.

The directory doc/ is generally the first place to look for any documentation.
