0.5.1 (May 3 2010)
- Added setting debugger.sms_modules to specify whether network modules from SMS
  should be loaded. Users reporting routing issues with those modules can turn
  it off to use the standard PS2SDK modules instead.
- Improved pattern searching (auto hook etc.)
- Fixed minor build issues.

0.5 (Dec 8 2009)
- Replaced existing network modules with EEUG's SMSMAP.irx and SMSTCPIP.irx, and
  optimized them for use in ps2rd (see below). This way, we almost doubled TCP
  transfer rates to about 1MB/s.
- SMSMAP: try to force 100Mb/s full duplex mode.
- SMSTCPIP: modify lwIP TCP/IP stack to save as much IOP RAM as possible.
- Disabled netlog support and shrinked size of RPC buffer in debugger.irx.
- Reduced footprint of dev9.irx and added dev9x device driver to it.
- Do not use syscall 251 to store original vector of SifSetReg().
- Tweaked Makefiles (less verbose etc.)
- Added compiler flags to ntpbclient: -O2 -s -m32
- Fixed games:
   Black
   Castlevania: COD - Demo
   Devil May Cry
   ICO - Demo
   Maximo VS AoZ - Demo
   Silent Hill 4: The Room
   Soul Calibur 2
   Soul Calibur 3
   TMNT - The Movie
   Tomb Raider: Anniversary
   Tomb Raider: Legend

0.4.2 (Oct 27 2009)
- This is an intermediate version created after renaming the project to "ps2rd".
  It doesn't include any bug fixes or new features.

0.4.1 (Oct 20 2009)
- The USB modules are now included and loaded by default, allowing you to read
  files from the mass: device. To disable USB support, change the new setting
  loader.usb_support to false.

0.4 (Oct 13 2009)
- Added video mode patcher.
- Finally fixed relocation of common symbols for all ERLs - no more SDK patches.
- ELF loader: copy LoadExecPS2 args in kernel mode and nul-terminate them
  properly to fix some multi-ELF games (e.g. Splinter Cell). Try to load ELF
  with SifLoadElf() first, allowing PES 2008 to boot.
- Apply SBV patches a 2nd time before loading our modules, ensuring that
  LoadModuleBuffer() works for games like TimeSplitters (pink screen problem).
- Added automatic patching of _SifLoadModule() to prevent network games from
  loading their dev9.irx and smap.irx modules. This way, we can hack games like
  GT4, Sniper Elite, and TimeSplitters 2 (enable debugger.patch_loadmodule).
- Added ability to disable the IOP reset hook after the first reset (enable
  debugger.unhook_iop_reset). This is similar to HD Loader's mode 3.
- Setting debugger.rpc_mode to -1 disables RPC for compatibility tests.
- Now there's only one dump command for all memory areas (NTPB protocol).
- Removed unused modules libc.erl, libdebug.erl, and netlog.irx.
- Added more documentation, e.g. doc/colors.html and doc/compat.txt.

0.3 (Sep 16 2009)
- Added support for DNAS games; Metal Gear Solid 3 is now hackable.
- Added ELF selector to directly boot/hack demos, for instance.
- All ERLs hook/unhook syscalls internally when they're loaded/unloaded.
- Game IDs: allow wildcard '?' in file name and add file size.
- In auto-hook mode, the debugger logs all hook addresses and original opcodes
  to a list at 0x000fff00. You can easily create Mastercodes from it.
- IP settings for PS2-side debugger are now configurable.
- Added setting debugger.load_modules and removed engine.file.
- Fixed handling of absolute paths for devices mass and mc0.
- Load IOP modules for USB access (ps2rd must be compiled with USB=1).
- Added updated version of ntpbclient.

0.2 (Aug 19 2009)
- Merged jimmikaelkael's code from Core Launcher v2 to allow remote debugging.
- Added ELF loader to replace evil LoadExecPS2() syscall.
- Except for the boot loader, all code was made relocatable.
- Reset IOP on startup by default; never do it when run from host.
- Stop disc spin after initialization to enable swapping.
- Cheats are only loaded once from text file on startup.
- Increased maximum number of active codes from 50 to 100.
- With code type D, if the number of lines is 0, it is internally set to 1 for
  compatibility.
- Added global debug mode (set DEBUG to 1 in root Makefile).
- Compressed final ELF with ps2-packer.

0.1 (Jul 29 2009)
- Initial public release
