0.4 (Oct xx 2009)
- Added video mode patcher. tbc
- Finally fixed relocation of common symbols for all ERLs - no more SDK patches.
- ELF loader: copy LoadExecPS2 args in kernel mode to fix some multi-ELF games.
  Try to load ELF with SifLoadElf() first, allowing Soul Calibur 2 to start.
- Apply SBV patches a 2nd time before loading our modules, ensuring that
  LoadModuleBuffer() works for games like TimeSplitters (pink screen problem).
- Added automatic patching of _SifLoadModule() to prevent network games from
  loading their dev9.irx and smap.irx modules. This way, we can hack games like
  Gran Turismo 4, PES 2008, and Sniper Elite (enable debugger.patch_loadmodule).
- Added ability to disable the IOP reset hook after the first reset (enable
  debugger.unhook_iop_reset). This is similar to HD Loader's mode 3.
- Setting debugger.rpc_mode to -1 disables RPC for compatibility tests.
- Removed unused modules libc.erl, libdebug.erl, and netlog.irx.
- Added overview about debug colors, see doc/colors.html.

0.3 (Sep 16 2009)
- Added support for DNAS games; Metal Gear Solid 3 is now hackable.
- Added ELF selector to directly boot/hack demos, for instance.
- All ERLs hook/unhook syscalls internally when they're loaded/unloaded.
- Game IDs: allow wildcard '?' in file name and add file size.
- In auto-hook mode, the debugger logs all hook addresses and original opcodes
  to a list at 0x000fff00. You can easily create Mastercodes from it.
- IP settings for PS2-side debugger are now configurable.
- Added setting debugger.load_modules and removed engine.file.
- Fixed handling of absolute paths for devices mass and mc0.
- Load IOP modules for USB access (Artemis must be compiled with USB=1).
- Added updated version of ntpbclient.

0.2 (Aug 19 2009)
- Merged jimmikaelkael's code from Core Launcher v2 to allow remote debugging.
- Added ELF loader to replace evil LoadExecPS2() syscall.
- Except for the boot loader, all code was made relocatable.
- Reset IOP on startup by default; never do it when run from host.
- Stop disc spin after initialization to enable swapping.
- Cheats are only loaded once from text file on startup.
- Increased maximum number of active codes from 50 to 100.
- With code type D, if the number of lines is 0, it is internally set to 1 for
  compatibility.
- Added global debug mode (set DEBUG to 1 in root Makefile).
- Compressed final ELF with ps2-packer.

0.1 (Jul 29 2009)
- Initial public release
