Developer Guidelines

All development of ps2rd takes place at http://bitbucket.org/misfire/ps2rd/.
The Mercurial repository is maintained by misfire. If you have anything to
contribute, don't hesitate to contact him.

Submitting patches is the favored way to contribute changes. For this, the first
thing to do is to clone the repository:

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/misfire/ps2rd/

To create a patch from your changes:

$ hg di -g [FILE] > foo.patch

Of course, you can also commit offline with "hg ci", and create patches from
your changesets:

$ hg out -p [-r REV]
or
$ hg log -p -r REV

Please try to always create a patch against the latest revision. Use "hg in" to
show new changesets found in the online repository, and "hg pull" to actually
pull changes to your local repository.

Finally, you can submit the patch files via email to misfire@xploderfreax.de

Thanks in advance.
