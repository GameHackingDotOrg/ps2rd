ps2rd includes a cheat system which has many features people are used to from
commercial products like CB and AR.

The current version allows you to load cheat codes from a text file and to
automatically activate them for the inserted game.

The configuration file holds a setting named "cheats.file" which specifies the
(absolute or relative) path to the cheats file to use, e.g. "mass:cheats.txt".
The cheats file must follow the format described in doc/cheats_format.txt. This
document also explains the concept of game IDs, and how to use them to auto-
matically activate cheats for a certain game.

Last but not least, take a look at doc/code_types.txt for a complete list of
available code types. Note that ps2rd only supports _raw_ codes.

Happy cheating!
