The main goal of Artemis is to provide means to debug commercial PS2 games
remotely over Ethernet.

The debugging capabilities include:
- dump contents of PS2 memory
- write data to PS2 memory (*)
- set breakpoints/watchpoints (*)

There's a dedicated "debugger" section in the configuration file - see
doc/config_help.txt for a list of all settings.

In order to debug games, you need to "hook" them first. This can be done by
either activating appropriate hook codes or by enabling automatic hooking in
the configuration file.
