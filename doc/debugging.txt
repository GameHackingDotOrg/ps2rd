The main goal of Artemis is to provide means to debug commercial PS2 games
remotely over Ethernet.

Artemis has a client-server architecture, where the PS2 serves requests from a
debugger client run on a PC.

The debugging capabilities include:
- dump contents of PS2 memory
- write data to PS2 memory (not implemented yet)
- set breakpoints/watchpoints (not implemented yet)

For the PS2 side, there's a dedicated "debugger" section in the configuration
file - see doc/config_help.txt for a list of all settings.

In order to debug games, you need to "hook" them first. This can be done by
either activating appropriate hook codes or by enabling automatic hooking in
the configuration file.

On the PC side, you can use ntpbclient to issue commands to the server.

Happy debugging!
