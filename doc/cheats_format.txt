ps2rd makes use of the libcheats library to read cheat codes in text format.

The format of the text file is quite simple:

"Game title 1 /ID NAME SIZE"
Cheat description 1
Cheat code 1
Cheat code 2
Cheat description 2
Cheat code 1
Cheat code 2

"Game title 2 /ID NAME SIZE"
etc.

The ID is used by the cheat system to auto-detect the inserted game and activate
codes accordingly. NAME must match (a substring of) the pathname of the ELF you
want to boot. This is most likely the ELF specified in SYSTEM.CNF. Further, you
can use the wildcard character '?' in NAME to match more than one ELF.

Examples for NAME:
- cdrom0:\SLES_820.32;1 matches cdrom0:\SLES_820.32;1
- SLES_820.32 matches cdrom0:\SLES_820.32;1
- SLES_820.1? matches cdrom0:\SLES_820.11;1 and cdrom0:\SLES_820.12;1

SIZE is the size of the ELF file in bytes. It is optional. If you want to omit
NAME and only use size as an identifier, insert the '-' character, e.g.:

"Metal Gear Solid 3-Snake Eater PAL /ID - 353476"


Also, two types of comments are allowed in the cheats file:
- Script-style comments. All text beginning with a ‘#’ character to the end of
  the line is ignored.
- C++-style comments. All text beginning with a ‘//’ sequence to the end of the
  line is ignored.

Sample:

"TimeSplitters PAL /ID SLES_500.78"
// some senseless comment
Mastercode

Invincible
