There're still games you can't hack with ps2rd, but we're working hard on
improving compatibility.

A list of working games can be found here:
https://bitbucket.org/misfire/ps2rd/wiki/Compat

By definition, a game is compatible and deserves the status "Working" when you
can dump memory at pretty much any point. There're also games that are only
partially compatible (status "Incomplete") or don't work at all ("Nothing").

ps2rd changes the background color to keep you informed about certain events
and errors - see doc/colors.html for an overview. Please always name this color
when reporting a non-working game.

Here're some specific steps to test compatibility. You can mainly influence
results by changing various settings of the debugger in the configuration file.
(It is assumed that your network is set up properly.)

1) Run the first test with these settings:
 * auto_hook = true
 * patch_loadmodule = false
 * unhook_iop_reset = false
 * rpc_mode = 1
 * load_modules = true

2) If the game starts, but you cannot connect/halt/dump, try this:
 * auto_hook = true
 * patch_loadmodule = true
 * unhook_iop_reset = false
 * rpc_mode = 1
 * load_modules = true

3) If the game crashes, use these settings (unhook IOP reset):
 * auto_hook = true
 * patch_loadmodule = false
 * unhook_iop_reset = true
 * rpc_mode = 1
 * load_modules = true

4) If it's still not working, try this (disable RPC):
 * auto_hook = true
 * patch_loadmodule = false
 * unhook_iop_reset = false
 * rpc_mode = -1
 * load_modules = true

5) Still no luck? Then change settings to (use blocking RPC):
 * auto_hook = true
 * patch_loadmodule = false
 * unhook_iop_reset = false
 * rpc_mode = 0
 * load_modules = true

6) Last but not least, try this (don't load additional IOP modules):
 * auto_hook = true
 * patch_loadmodule = false
 * unhook_iop_reset = false
 * rpc_mode = 0
 * load_modules = false

It is also possible that auto hooking fails to find a proper hook location. Then
you can try to disable it, and add your own hook code(s) to the cheats file.

Please report any results to the compatibility list. Be as specific as possible.

Thanks in advance.
