ntpbclient is a PC client to issue commands to the PS2 server program.

You need a working Perl distribution to run it (e.g. ActivePerl on Windows).

By default, ntpbclient connects to 192.168.0.10. You can change the IP by
setting the variable "PS2_IP" in your environment.

Usage:

ntpbclient: <command> [args]
Supported commands:
    halt                      halt game execution
    resume                    resume game execution
    dump <start> <end> <file> dump memory to file

Examples:

$ perl ntpbclient halt
$ perl ntpbclient resume
$ perl ntpbclient dump bfc00000 c0000000 bios.bin
$ perl ntpbclient dump 00100000 02000000 user.bin
