The powerful features of PS2rd can be used with Open PS2 Loader (OPL).

For this, PS2rd has to launch OPL. You can easily do this by adding the OPL ELF
to loader.boot2 in ps2rd.conf. When PS2rd has started, manually select game
cheats (auto-activation won't work here), and launch OPL.

So the boot order goes as follows:

  PS2rd --> OPL --> PS2 game

While cheat system and video mode patcher integrate flawlessly with OPL, the
debugger isn't compatible yet. Therefore, you need to disable it by setting
debugger.install to "false". Otherwise, OPL will crash!
